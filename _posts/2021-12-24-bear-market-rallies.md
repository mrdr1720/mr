They are of a different character than typical bull market rallies and have these traits in common:

<ul>
  <li>Gigantic in magnitude</li>
  <li>Late-cycle, early in a downtrend</li>
  <li>Elevated sentiment (chest-pounding from bulls, totally convinced we aren’t going lower- as an aside this is also true during bull markets, so it’s important to consider the other factors as well)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The rally we saw this week from Tuesday through Thursday that took the Nasdaq-100 up more than 5% is more evidence of a bear market than not. Yes, that’s right. Not buying this rally either. People often cite the 9-1 or double 8-2 up days as bullish indicators but I believe these only have relevance if you are in a solid uptrend in all indices and preferably early cycle with depressed sentiment. At the current stage of the cycle I believe they carry much less weight.

Bear market rallies occur because when bull markets end it is not apparent to anyone. So there are these pockets of calm as the selling unfolds where a continent is convinced it’s another buying opportunity, the selling stops for a day or two or three, and in this pocket of calm like the eye of a hurricane passing over, the bulls rush back in and drive prices up almost vertically. This only further reinforces the bulls bias towards the market and this is evidence from the resurgence in bullish rhetoric and football spiking on the bears. Then the selling continues and the bulls get battered again. Rinse and repeat. Eventually the bottom falls out and the market collapses and real fear, not the horse shit sentiment readings like the NAAIM and CNN Fear and Greed Index takes hold and nobody wants to touch risky assets. Then you may be closer to a bottom. We ain’t there yet. Not even close. There are just way too many permabulls convinced of their genius for me to buy it.

This market is very mixed despite all of the bullish rhetoric. Breadth has not returned and now money is extremely concentrated in a small basket of stocks which just happens to be what the S&P tracks and the S&P is what everyone follows so it has everyone masked from the extreme volatility happening beneath the surface. If the megacaps give way the entire market is going to come down and in a terrifying way. I don’t think anyone is really considering the amount of risk present right now given how heavily concentrated the average person’s wealth is in a few extremely expensive risk assets.
