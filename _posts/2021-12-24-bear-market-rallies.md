They are of a different character than typical bull market rallies and have these traits in common:

<ul>
  <li>Gigantic in magnitude</li>
  <li>Late-cycle, early in a downtrend</li>
  <li><b>Extremely</b> elevated sentiment (chest-pounding from bulls totally convinced we aren’t going lower- as an aside this is also true during bull markets, so it’s important to consider the other factors as well, but in a bear market rally the sentiment is of a different nature because it has a major "phew/relief/euphoric" flavor to it like you might feel after you survived your first skydive, except in this case you don't realize you haven't touched ground yet)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The rally we saw this week from Tuesday through Thursday that took the Nasdaq-100 up more than 5% is more evidence of a bear market than not. Yes, that’s right. Not buying this rally either. People often cite the 9-1 or double 8-2 up days as bullish indicators but I believe these only have relevance if you are in a solid uptrend in all indices and preferably early cycle with depressed sentiment. At the current stage of the cycle I believe they carry much less weight.

Bear market rallies occur because when bull markets end it is not apparent to anyone. So there are these pockets of calm as the selling unfolds where a contingent of those bulls who didn't see a sell-off coming and got trapped in the first one or two and hoped for a resumption of the bull market is now convinced it’s yet another buying opportunity. Then the selling stops for a day or two or three, and in this pocket of calm like the eye of a hurricane passing over, the bulls rush back in and drive prices up almost vertically.

The trapped bulls now have no impulse to get out and miss the continuation of the bull market and this massive rally only further reinforces the bulls' bias towards the market. This is evidenced from the resurgence in bullish rhetoric and football spiking on the bears. Then a day or two later the selling inexplicably continues and the bulls get battered again. Rinse and repeat.

Eventually the bottom falls out and the market collapses and real fear, not the horse shit sentiment readings like the NAAIM and CNN Fear and Greed Index takes hold and nobody wants to touch risky assets. Then you may be closer to a bottom. We ain’t there yet. Not even close. There are just way too many permabulls convinced of their genius at this stage for me to buy it.

This market is very mixed despite all of the bullish rhetoric. Breadth has not returned and now money is extremely concentrated in a small basket of stocks which just happens to be what the S&P tracks and the S&P is what everyone follows so it has everyone masked from the extreme volatility happening beneath the surface. Actually, that's a bit disingenuous. There's been a lot of commentary of that underlying volatility, but most view it as bullish rather than worrisome because they think that the selling in those high beta stocks has likely bottomed and now everything will resume the uptrend. If the megacaps give way the entire market is going to come down and in a terrifying way. I don’t think anyone is really considering the amount of risk present right now given how heavily concentrated the average person’s wealth is in a few extremely expensive risk assets. I think we need a reminder that as iron-clad as Apple and Microsoft seem to be, they are risky assets. And despite the consensus view that they are cheap, they are not.
