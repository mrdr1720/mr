title: Narrative Shifts

One of the most remarkable things I’ve witnessed in some time is the shift in narrative that has occurred over the past month, although I’m not sure why I should be surprised.

Yesterday at 2:00pm the hugely-anticipated FOMC decision was released, followed by a press conference. Now, to paint the full picture, let’s rewind to early November to the last FOMC meeting. At that meeting, the plan to begin tapering asset purchases was first announced. This was after growing pressure from economists and even increasingly market watchers who in the past had criticized any hawkish fed moves. The inflation numbers were too great and the idea of the fed continuing to pump billions of dollars a month into a red-hot economy was too much to ignore.

In response to this, small caps began to sell off and the VALUG officially hit a 4% week over week downtrend. Then on Thanksgiving night, news of the COVID Omnicron variant hit and the market sold off hard. Even after it became apparent that the economy was not going to shut down again and that the Omnicron might actually be positive since it could be more transmissible but less deadly than the standard or Delta variants, the market continued down. This made it pretty apparent that the market weakness was mostly due to the November FOMC decision.

Then in the days ahead of yesterday’s FOMC, reports began to circulate that the Fed might actually double its tapering rate and start rate hikes sooner, possibly as early as March (just a few months ago it was debated whether they would raise them at all in 2022 but that even if they did it was almost certainly not going to happen before the Fall). A double-whammy for stocks, right?

Well…

With these rumors circulating of a more hawkish fed, selling indeed began to accelerate ahead of yesterday’s FOMC. But in the days leading up to the meeting, I began to read lots of commentary and opinions from clever market watchers who believed that with so much selling, the market had likely priced in any tapering and that the risk on decision day was actually to the upside.

Well, yesterday morning the market was pretty red and at 2:00pm Eastern when the minutes were released, the market initially began to go down and rates across the curve spike, but quickly reversed course and then stocks essentially went vertical into the close, the Nasdaq-100 staging something like a 500 point reversal!

As of now, it would seem the permabulls have won another decisive battle.

But… (there’s always a but)

I came across the following article written in March of 2000 in the early stages of the dot-com bust: https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/21/markets/markets_newyork/

I find the parallels interesting. Even though the Fed was already in the midst of tightening and rates were much higher then and that hike resulted in an inverted yield curve, I think the situations are similar from a sentiment standpoint. The market rallied over 2% on the back of this news, showing the thrust of bear market rallies. You see, bear market rallies fool everyone, bulls and bears and that’s because they create the reality, yes, that’s correct, the reality, not the illusion, that the bull market is back on. It has to. Market participants aren’t stupid or irrational. They won’t simply buy into a resurrection of the bull market if it’s not convincing. Bears won’t abandon short thesis’s and cover shorts if the rallies don’t seem to be extraordinarily powerful.

There are a few reasons I’m not buying yesterday’s rally:

1. There is simply no way the Fed doubling the pace of tapering and now planning three rate hikes in 2022, with the first coming as early as March is bullish.
2. Markets that rally 2% in the midst of a downtrend near ATH’s are more likely in a bear market than not.
3. To that point, we are still in a downtrend.
4. There has been very little damage to sentiment still.

What I find really interesting though is how opinions change. Just a couple of months ago, even tapering was highly in question. Now with an accelerated taper and three hikes being announced, the market is heralding this as bullish. It’s amazing what a combination of a bullish bias, long positions, an hour’s worth of supportive price action can do to people’s sentiment. People are now actually convinced a hawkish fed is bullish and are calling for a Santa Claus rally into year end! I have to admit I never saw this coming. I expect heavy selling to return soon, as early as today.
