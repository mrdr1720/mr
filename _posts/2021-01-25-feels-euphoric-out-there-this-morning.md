Lots of dunking on short sellers this morning. Massive run in megacap tech into earnings. Many posting
enormous gains with extreme confidence. The proclamation that short-selling is dead.

I finally believe we are at a top. I think it's time to get ready. Just need confirmation from the tape. Looking for a correction to begin sooner than later. A "buyable" correction, of course :).
