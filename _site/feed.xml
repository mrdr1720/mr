As so often happens these things are clear in retrospect. But in light of what has happened over the past several weeks I think the least I can do is figure out where I went wrong and what to do moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past several months I had been looking for a market crash. All the signs were there- excessive optimism, P/E ratios that were completely off the charts and speculation going on with call options that was driving many stocks to stratospheric levels. It turns out the call for the market crash wasn’t off. The market crash did occur, but the reason I didn’t capitalize on it had entirely to do with how we define “the market”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What do we mean when we say “the market”?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, let’s take a step back. Many, many years ago in the late 19th century, stock trading was a difficult business. Many of the things we take for granted today- instant real-time quotes on any stock or commodity, the ability to view charts of historic prices and volume, put to call ratio and thousands of other data points simply didn’t exist. Traders were limited to viewing a few quotes on a slowly-moving ticker tape that was very often delayed. Of course everyone had this working against them so it didn’t necessarily provide a huge disadvantage to the individual trader. But at the same time it was very difficult to figure out what the overall market of stocks was doing on any given day at least without extensive amounts of work. You would have had to record prices throughout the day or at least closing prices, then compile them into an average, and track that average over time, by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, some very smart people realized the utility of being able to surmise at any point what the market was doing and set about doing this by creating stock market averages, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;amp;P 500. Later came equal-weighted indices like the Value Line Geometric Index. At a time when compiling these was a massive headache, they did so and published them in newspapers. In those days, the averages did a pretty good job of tracking the market and looking at an average gave you a pretty good idea of what markets overall were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s fast forward to today. You have many multiples more of stocks and ETFs, ETNs, and funds operating in many different industries. It seems as if the market has outgrown the averages. Granted many new averages have been created, but still and all most traders these days focus on three- the S&amp;amp;P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq-100. There’s good reason for this as these averages not so coincidentally track the largest stocks by price and/or market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you were to look at a chart of the S&amp;amp;P 500 not knowing anything else about the current state of the market and what individual issues have done over the past year, you would probably laugh if someone told you that we are in the midst of a crash. At best a decent-sized correction. After all, it is hovering just above levels it was at last October and is down all of 1.29% in the past six months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our definition of the market must evolve to account for the fact that there is very little correlation in the moves between the average stock and the parts that experienced the blow off tops that I wrote about a month or two ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mistake I and so many others made was assuming that these blow-off tops would have large ramifications on the entire market of stocks. But that largely hasn’t materialized. The stocks that never really went up leaps and bounds like NVDA, FB, or NFLX did last summer and fall, have come down but not nearly in the devastating manner that those stocks have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we define the market as the parts that have caused the greatest concern- the ARK innovation type stocks and those that went up 50-80% in a span of a couple of months last year, we have experienced a crash. Crashes, by the way, historically last about 6-10 weeks. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what happened?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two key events that led to the blow-off top and ensuing crash in select parts of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there was an acceleration of call-buying in a basket of extremely speculative names. As the call-buying continued and these stocks rose, dealer hedging resulted in gamma squeezes that drove stocks like NVDA up from an October 4th low of $197.32 to a high of $333.76 just seven weeks later- an increase of 69%! NVDA certainly wasn’t alone- many other stocks such as FB, NFLX and even AAPL and MSFT to an extent experienced similar blow-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second factor was the fed formally announcing the tapering of asset purchases accompanied by growing inflation concerns. It is no coincidence that these stocks peaked right around that time. It became clear that liquidity was going to get pulled back in the near future, and however gradually that might happen, growthy speculative stuff was not going to perform well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually called the blow-off top and fed effects with great precision. But where I fell short was equating this with the overall market which really didn’t participate to the same extent to the upside or downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are trying to form a picture of what the current state of the market is and where it is likely to go, it is so important to pull back your focus and widen the lens and keep a reasonable perspective based on all factors. It is very easy when you get scary intraday drawdowns in the Nasdaq-100 of 300-400 points like we did Thursday and Friday this week to buy into bearish scenarios such as the impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict or rising rates or forthcoming draconian Fed measures to yank back liquidity and extrapolate that into a further crash, which is what many have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marty Zweig wrote about the three factors necessary for a bear market. They are extreme deflation, ultrahigh P/E ratios, and an inverted yield curve. Not all three need to be present, any one &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; trigger a bear market but without at least one a bear market is extremely unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly we don’t have extreme deflation, rather we have high inflation. We did have ultrahigh P/E ratios and I would argue we still do in many areas including the averages. Last but most importantly because this is the big one- &lt;b&gt;we do not have an inverted yield curve.&lt;/b&gt; For all the fed fear and talk about rising rates, we are nowhere close to an inverted curve. In fact the areas of the market that would actually cause a recession- commercial paper rates, for example are up all of 25 basis points in the past three months. This is not a surprise because the fed hasn’t lifted a finger yet! And yet active market participants are fixated on treasury yields which fluctuate on a daily basis to every headline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One must realize that the market has actually done just fine in a rising rate environment so long as rates are starting from a low base, which clearly they are. It is problematic that P/E’s still seem elevated but again, rates are so low higher P/E’s are to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned previously, market crashes tend to last between 6-10 weeks. If we say this market crash began in earnest last November, let’s say smack in the middle, we are about eight to nine weeks out from the beginning. Given all factors I strongly believe that the worst part of this crash has happened although it has happened on a rolling basis- first NFLX, then FB, and on and on, individual stocks have been crashing. I attribute this largely to hope propping these stocks up in a very weak market for them, then any bad news causing a wave of selling with little appetite to step in and buy. This has caused extraordinary downdrafts in these stocks. But I think it really has very little cause for concern as it relates to the economy or even many of these companies. FB, for example seems like a very good opportunity, even if it goes lower. Especially if it goes lower. I think it is highly likely the worst is over and the selling this week was just a retest down to the January lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think it’s certainly possible that we go lower maybe with a dramatic red opening early next week, a major bounce is likely followed by a rangy trade. I wouldn’t get super optimistic about an immediate resumption of the bull market, but calls for a crash from here for the overall market seem extremely mis-timed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last clue that we are near a bottom- it is a common characteristic of markets that haven’t bottomed to have gigantic counter-trend rallies. We aren’t seeing that at all. Instead I’m seeing lots of fear and crash calls for a market that simply isn’t demonstrating anything that concerning from a fundamental or technical level. We haven’t even taken out the lows of January. The worst crashes hit complacent markets and we clearly don’t have that. They also hit the worst phases at the tail end in a span of a few days at lower prices and much higher volume. Again, we’re not seeing that. Volume over the past two sessions was actually extremely low. Finally, to reiterate this point, there is not much correlation between the overall market which while down, is acting fine, and individual issues that don’t seem to be able to find a bottom. The market is crashing in phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the market seems to just need a jolt of optimism to trigger buying again. Not sure exactly when that will happen but we aren’t far off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best ideas to play this: short VIX, long S&amp;amp;P equal-weight as I don’t necessarily believe an appetite for the speculative stuff is likely to return.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I had to come to a realization this week- that I have been flat wrong on the markets over the past few months.

There were cross-currents of a hawkish fed mixed with great earnings from Microsoft and Apple. Apple’s results last night which were nothing short of extraordinary plus some dovish talk from Neal Kashkari caused a major relief rally today in the market. It looks like it will close at the high of the day with the Nasdaq-100 closing up around 433 points, or 3.17%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t come as a surprise, but I’m going to pour cold water on this rally and say we aren’t a bottom yet. Not even close. I still feel like we are in the early innings of a major decline. The timing of these things is always hard to work out but I don’t expect it to go on too long, maybe another couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I see. Right now, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are basically the market. Together they comprise about 20% of the S&amp;amp;P. Amazon has been extremely weak of late, but the other three have held up remarkably well given the volatility in the rest of the market. However I don’t think the market will bottom until everything participates in the downside to a large extent and we get some mean reversion in the weighted indices. Such a small number of stocks comprising so much market capitalization poses a pretty large risk to the economy because most passive investors are heavily invested in the S&amp;amp;P so, by extension, are heavily weighted to those four stocks. If those four stocks were to drop significantly, lots of people would see drastically diminished 401k balances which would make them feel less wealthy, spend less and have a negative impact on the economy. This is the wealth effect in action, or as George Soros might describe it as a reflexive relationship where the market prices have a direct impact on the earnings of the companies they represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at a one-year chart of Apple, Microsoft, or Alphabet we will see a pattern familiar to markets right before they crash. A long, consolidating period (summer of 2021) followed by a near-vertical rally of 20-30% over the course of three months or so (October-December of 2021), followed by a relatively benign “normal” correction (early January through the beginning of this week), followed by a sharp reversal up recouping about half the decline (the latter half of this week and possibly continuing into next week) followed by a massive quick drop, climaxing over the course of about 1-2 weeks (TBD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me sentiment is still very risk-on and there are many talking heads calling Monday’s drop capitulation. It’s certainly possible, you never really know. Still, it’s very hard for me to understand with the monetary policy outlook for the next year or so that at current valuations, stocks are a buy. I firmly believe that Apple has achieved its permanent all-time high. That’s a controversial statement given that they just reported blow-out numbers. But, show me a company that is still growing that was the leading company of its day ten, twenty, or thirty years ago. Companies go through evolutions and lifecycles just like people and when they are at their peak, the only way is down. I truly believe Apple has peaked but the fundamentals haven’t. This is how markets work. Stock prices tend to peak while the outlook is still extremely favorable and there isn’t a bear case to be had. If they dropped when it was obvious, everyone would make a lot of money. Or nobody would. It doesn’t matter whether you’re in a bull market or a bear market- once the fundamentals align with the price action, there’s a good chance most of the opportunity has already been wrung out. That’s certainly how Apple feels at the moment. I feel certain this stock will be lower a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the only one. Microsoft’s chart looks similar and it’s price action post-earnings should be troubling to the bulls. After reporting massive earnings growth it could barely stay over $300 and failed multiple times this week before finally closing over $300 today after a very shaky gain. There just isn’t much momentum there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the market level, as discussed ad nauseam here, 3-4% rallies in a downtrend are a bearish signal and today’s ramp up into the close actually makes me feel better about this call, not worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as also mentioned here multiple times, sentiment is not close to bottoming yet. We are at what feels like an early phase where people who think they’re clever are looking for signs of capitulation. Things like the 1100 point drop in the Dow on Monday or the bear-bull survey that showed the lowest reading since the Covid crash. But that’s not real capitulation. You can’t summarize true sentiment from a survey or some widely-disseminated numbers. You can’t gauge it from oversold conditions. You have to put in the work to get to know multiple people who follow the market and gauge &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; reactions to it. So far I sense no real fear and a continued reluctance to accept the facts as they’re presented. Complete denial. Not even allowing for the possibility this market will go lower. People look at a large, quick drop like we’ve experienced over the past 3-4 weeks and believe the worst is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sign the denial is strong: on Tuesday after Monday’s massive drop, a Bloomberg article made the rounds citing a JP Morgan analyst who attributed Monday’s selling to retail investors panicking. The implication being that it was “dumb retail money” that was selling and then “smart institutional money” that came into buy the dip, taking such great deals off of poor retail’s hands. This type of straw-man story is very comforting to the bulls and further enforces their ill-informed idea that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the smartest people in the room and on the same side of the trade as this mysterious institutional smart money. Never mind that most institutions fail to match the S&amp;amp;P’s performance nearly every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Real&lt;/i&gt; capitulation happens when everyone is terrified- bulls and bears and for very good reasons. Nobody wants to touch stocks because of the absolute devastation they’ve created. The pattern never fails. People are arrogant and believe that they are above everyone else past and present. People who panic-sold in previous panics near the bottom were stupid and irrational. This gives them the belief that they can easily spot fear in others and every drop is a great opportunity. They never stop to ask themselves why they didn’t think to buy on previous bottoms whether they be in 2010, 2018, or 2020. They get drawn in in the 8th inning of a bull run and then continue to buy as the market starts into a tailspin. What people fail to understand is that it is never apparent when a bear market is starting because the fundamentals haven’t emerged yet. People are simply taking risk off before the economy turns down. By the time the evidence is there, it’s too late. These people provide the opportunity in sell-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it brings me no joy to continue on and on about a bear market or crash. I’m not a doomsdayer normally and I consider myself an optimist. But a person who can’t accept facts as they are presented is doomed to fail in this business. If true capitulation were to be reached by my own measures, I would definitely switch to being a bull, but I just can’t in this market environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This week was extraordinarily volatile with massive intraday swings of hundreds of points in the Nasdaq-100 pretty much every day.

I had reasoned that a drop would need to begin more gradually before getting into the crash/extreme correction phase. But once the markets crossed a certain point on Friday and then this morning, that analysis went out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the market staged one hell of a reversal into the close today and ended green after being down more than 700 points on the Nasdaq-100 and I used the opportunity to sell the SPY calls I bought on Thursday somehow only down about 25% despite the S&amp;amp;P being about 100 points lower. I don’t think we’ve touched bottom here. What a difference a few days makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why I think we have more pain in this selloff. If you look at previous crashes/deep corrections, a familiar pattern emerges. Volume picks up to ridiculous levels as selling accelerates, sentiment gets flushed, and the market way overshoots to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volume today was enormous, as was it on Friday. But something about sentiment today makes me think we have further to go in this selloff. We are at the phase where people are joking and many are talking about capitulation and buyable dips. Markets don’t bottom when people recognize capitulation and say it’s time to buy. People spot what they think is capitulation, the market rallies, then drops much more as real capitulation occurs, chaos emerges and rumors start to circulate about margin calls and insolvency. Then panic sets in and you find a bottom. We aren’t there yet. Though deep and fast as this drop has been, it doesn’t seem to have created any real fear. There’s still tons of dip-buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the case of the 1929 market crash. On Monday, October 21st, the market dropped on near-record volume then staged a bit of a comeback towards the end of the day and the market rallied on Tuesday, accompanied by reassurances that all was well from some well-respected commentators. But then on Wednesday the selling returned and things got much worse from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is 1929. I don’t even think it’s anything more than a price and sentiment correction similar to 1962 given that there’s no damage in credit markets or economic warnings. But stocks like Tesla and Nvidia that had astronomical rises towards the end of the year need to come down more in my opinion. There still hasn’t been lasting damage to sentiment. If anything if we bottomed here it would only make people more bullish. I’d like to see a flush in a stock like Tesla of 50% or so. Sounds dramatic I know but so far we’ve only undone about three months worth of gains. Consider that Nvidia in October was around $200. Even after this correction it’s up 15% from those levels. We need to undo more like a year or two of gains, which for the QQQ’s would take us down to 240 or so. Nvidia to $120 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect a decent market tomorrow as we await the Fed and some large earnings reports but I don’t think either can do anything other than pause the selling and if we get a rally tomorrow and the VIX drops I’d be willing to go for some short-dated very OTM puts on the QQQ’s again. I believe we are close to a bottom in time, as I think we would get this dramatic selloff sometime early next week, but I think we aren’t close in price. I’m looking for chaos, real fear and a massive overshoot to the downside before I’d be looking for a lasting reversal. People always underestimate how much damage can be done. I think there will come a point where a great buying opportunity will come but we haven’t reached it yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">So clearly I was wrong on my bottom call last week.

To be clear, I am not saying this is &lt;i&gt;the bottom&lt;/i&gt;. Far from it. But my call for the past couple of weeks has been for what I’ve dubbed a “faux correction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by faux correction is an interim correction that people later think was &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; correction which allows them to get bulled up again when stocks start rallying and actually sustain it over a period of several weeks allowing them to get trapped for the real bear market, the assumption being that with the correction being so close in the rear view mirror, no way we will go back down again and that the fed news and such has been more than discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I’m calling this the bottom in the faux correction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The S&amp;amp;P hit my faux correction target level of 4470 today&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sentiment seemed to hit a real short-term flush today, especially on the back of the Peloton news&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Earnings are starting and I suspect there will be a rush of money back into the market to position for them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even though the absolute level of the selloff didn’t seem like capitulation, peak to trough the NQ dropped more than 500 points!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Consequently I bought a handful of 5% OTM SPY calls towards the close. I think we could get a strong rally maybe tomorrow or early next week. I’d expect that rally to be both enormous and not believed (the hallmarks of a strong interim rally) and I’d look to pitch these after a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the S&amp;amp;P could carry itself back up towards an ATH but stop just shy of it, maybe 2-3% below. I’m calling for a ~5% rally back, but not the vertical sort we got in December, more like a strong 2% pop (at which point I’d pitch my calls) then a more gradual ascent over the course of a few weeks which would peter out. It would really help sentiment get offsides if we get some strong earnings beats along the way. I think this would be necessary actually to get sentiment positioned very long stocks just in time for the real correction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I very rarely do this and I’m certain I’ll regret it, but I’m going to go out on a limb and call a tactical bottom today.

The implication being that we are in something similar to 1997 or so right now and the market should rise another three years at least because we are just now talking about the Fed raising rates. I believe these comparisons to be ill-informed and I’ll explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late 90’s was a bona fide bubble. The focus of the market in those days was on this new emerging thing called the internet and all of its potential. Any person that could fog a mirror could take a company public and see its value ascend many multiples overnight. That boat lifted great companies with tons of potential right alongside crap that had no chance of ever making any money, as all bubbles do. Rates were totally in the background. All anyone was focused on was internet, software and hardware companies. So when Greenspan began talking about irrational exuberance and needing to curb it, it was like someone asking you to turn the music down at a party. But the focus is on the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current market environment there are surely some tiny pockets that look like bubbles- EV’s, crytpocurrencies, the meta verse to an extent. But that’s not the real story. In the current market environment the Fed is the story. Low rates are the story. They are the entire focus of the market. It’s all anyone who follows the market talks about. For the past two years the unfailing bull item has been low rates, low rates, low rates. Free money for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s curious to me then, that now that the Fed is talking about reducing liquidity and raising rates that people still think that this should have no effect on market psychology. If continued zero rates is bullish, then why is a departure from that not bearish? In other words, if you are bullish on stocks for more than a year with no real change to interest rates or the liquidity story, then why when a change to that story comes, why doesn’t the bull case change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that because low rates and continued liquidity injections are the reason for the market’s ascent over the past two years that when that story begins to change the character of the market will change. There is no real diversion to make rates a sideshow. We don’t have a new industry enriching millions of people and raising GDP. It’s all based on helicopter money.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Lately I’ve seen so many comparisons of the current environment to the late 90’s and other cycles where the market rose in a higher rate environment and even after multiple rate hikes. The implication being that we are in something similar to 1997 or so right now and the market should rise another three years at least because we are just now talking about the Fed raising rates. I believe these comparisons to be ill-informed and I’ll explain why.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Crash Isn’t Here.

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sentiment is extremely bearish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The move is not yet confirmed in high yield credit, equal weighted indices, the S&amp;amp;P or the DJIA. The only index in a (slight) downtrend is the Nasdaq 100, which I think will probably revert back onto a buy before the rest go to a sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Why the sudden change after so much bearish rhetoric over the past several weeks/months?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the previous two points, the current setup to me seems very similar to the lead in to the 1962 crash. So, I’m still very bearish just not tactically at the current moment. I don’t think there’s a ton of upside, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1961, the market ran way up into the end of the year with a massive rally into the very end of the year. After that, the market began to drop in January of 1962. But it didn’t immediately crash. Instead it dropped for all of January, pretty substantially, but then had a decent pop throughout February and March before finally caving in in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking about that entire move, it strikes me that a similar type of market could get people wildly offsides in the current market. In other words, the max pain trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I’m looking for is a decent drop over the next few weeks that could take the S&amp;amp;P down to around 4490 or so making sentiment extremely cautious. I think the market could then reverse back up and have a nice, sustained rally for as much as two months, restoring calm and I would expect the VIX to come back comfortably below 15. At that point the market could reverse back lower and then the real drop begin. Convinced the prior drop was the correction, this next drop would be viewed as a buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is weirdly specific, but it’s actually describing a head and shoulders pattern on the S&amp;amp;P, which is what happened in 1962. Whatever the case, I see a pretty weak market and I’m not really making any moves at this point until I get a better read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just think there are too many expecting a massive drop without a whole lot of confirmation from the market. I too believe a big drop is coming, but the timing isn’t right for it, yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The main reasons are:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">This indeed looks like a blow-off top.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/29/this-indeed-looks-like-a-blow-off-top.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="This indeed looks like a blow-off top." /><published>2021-12-29T11:55:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-29T11:55:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/12/29/this-indeed-looks-like-a-blow-off-top</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/29/this-indeed-looks-like-a-blow-off-top.html">&lt;p&gt;It appears increasingly likely that from early October through the beginning to end of November (depending on which chart you look at) Tesla, Apple, Bitcoin, AMD, and Nvidia (and I’m sure several other high-risk names) put in blow-off tops. The rally that we saw from last Tuesday through this past Monday is now looking like a textbook bear-market rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these stocks viewed as a microcosm look very similar to the markets of 1929, 1987, and 2000 right before they crashed. Even though I’ve been bearish on the indices I do believe that if these names collapse over the coming weeks it will almost certainly take the rest of the market down with it, given the concentration of cash in these names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market has been very top-heavy. I’ve been asking myself for over a year, what will finally put a bullet in the risk appetite that people have currently, and I am starting to think a collapse in these extremely speculative names could be just the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If history is any guide, by the way, I would expect the heavy selling to come over the next few weeks. In 1929, the crash phase lasted eight weeks. In 1987 it was about seven. 2000 was longer but the market was also much more elevated than it is now. I would expect all of these names to come down anywhere from 30-50% if a collapse occurs which I wouldn’t rule out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I acting so sure about a seemingly improbable event? Because of the nature of blow-off tops and the resulting collapse that almost always occurs. Also we are at the full on delusion phase of the Tesla bubble. The narrative from that camp has gone from hopeful to wildly insane. We &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; this correction to restore common sense and order to these markets though it will cost a lot of people massive gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a price standpoint, a bull would have hoped for yesterday’s pause to resume to the upside but a premarket bid for all of these names quickly collapsed and now they are all pretty solidly red. The risk reward to shorting these right now is as good as I have seen it maybe ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It appears increasingly likely that from early October through the beginning to end of November (depending on which chart you look at) Tesla, Apple, Bitcoin, AMD, and Nvidia (and I’m sure several other high-risk names) put in blow-off tops.

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a step back and rewind to the beginning of that lead-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November of 2016, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. This caught most everyone off-guard and the market was no exception. People didn’t know what to expect, but there was a real sense of worry about the future of the country. The market responded by going limit-down and several op-eds were published about how the market would crash and America was doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then something unexpected happened. The market reversed and one of the great bull runs of the modern era took hold. I don’t want to make this political but the reality is that most traders lean right politically due to the tax implications and free market ideals that Republicans (whether deserved or not) are known for. So there was this sort of tug of war going on between the left who were convinced that Trump was bad for America and by extension, the markets, and traders who were rightly convinced that he was great for the markets. If they could shove that in the liberals’ faces by making money off how wrong they were, all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was from this derision that the short vol trade was born. In the aftermath of the election and in the ensuing bull run, the VIX dropped to a historically low level and hovered down near 11 for months and people quickly embraced the Trump stock market and came piling into risky assets. Capitalizing on this, traders began shorting volatility, most notably through the UVXY. The other popular vehicles were shorting VXX and going long XIV, the inverse VIX ETN (which ended up largely causing Volmageddon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2017 this trade made many people very wealthy and more and more people began to pile into the short VIX trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then one day in early February 2018, the impossible happened and all of those clever traders got their asses blown out by Mr. Market, as must always happen when any contingent gets too arrogant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live by a few maxims when it comes to the market and one is that nobody, and by that I mean &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt; is infallible. Despite common lore, there is not a single man, woman, or child who is not acting on inside information who will stay on the right side of a trade in perpetuity or even the majority of the time. This is well documented throughout history, and yet people still believe in these mysterious market participants who have their fingers on the pulse of the market and never lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to Volmageddon there was a palpable arrogance among those who had been riding that trade and they were fully convinced of their genius. And for many months they were absolutely correct on the trade. But they got greedy and eventually blew out. Same old story. As it turns out bubbles crop up in lots of places, not just long stocks or real estate. You just have to recognize the signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that we are at a similar point now in the market. But this time, instead of capitalizing on a perpetually low VIX by shorting VIX futures, they are capitalizing on a perpetually elevated VIX by shorting put options, namely the SPY and QQQ and a few high fliers like Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see over the past year a similar trade has emerged where a contingent of market participants have convinced themselves of their own greatness and believe they have a sure-fire read on the market and that due to reflexivity the market will never go down due to all of the put buying. And for months and months the put buyers have been consistently shown to be on the wrong side of the trade. But as we should know by now, that can only go on for so long. Selling downside put protection is this cycle’s can’t miss trade and anyone buying downside put protection is viewed as a sucker and those selling it think they are Jesse Livermore Tudor Jones Icahn. This trade is getting long in the tooth and the put sellers are reaching a fever pitch of arrogance. Given the recent volatility and a sort of tipping point in arrogance towards this trade, I wonder if we aren’t in store for a similar blow-out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In the lead-up to the Volmageddon episode that took place on February 5th, 2018, there was a can’t-miss trade.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bear Market Rallies</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/24/bear-market-rallies.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bear Market Rallies" /><published>2021-12-24T12:05:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-24T12:05:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/12/24/bear-market-rallies</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/24/bear-market-rallies.html">&lt;p&gt;They are of a different character than typical bull market rallies and have these traits in common:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gigantic in magnitude&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Late-cycle, early in a downtrend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extremely&lt;/b&gt; elevated sentiment (chest-pounding from bulls totally convinced we aren’t going lower- as an aside this is also true during bull markets, so it’s important to consider the other factors as well, but in a bear market rally the sentiment is of a different nature because it&apos;s born from an initial sense of fear and so it has a major &quot;phew/relief/euphoric&quot; flavor to it like you might feel after you survived your first skydive, except in this case you don&apos;t realize you haven&apos;t touched ground yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The rally we saw this week from Tuesday through Thursday that took the Nasdaq-100 up more than 5% is more evidence of a bear market than not. Yes, that’s right. Not buying this rally either. People often cite the 9-1 or double 8-2 up days as bullish indicators but I believe these only have relevance if you are in a solid uptrend in all indices and preferably early cycle with depressed sentiment. At the current stage of the cycle I believe they carry much less weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear market rallies occur because when bull markets end there is always a period of great uncertainty. Bears are unsure if it will culminate in a major slide while bulls hope it’s just a buyable dip. So there are these pockets of calm as the selling unfolds where a contingent of those bulls who didn’t see a sell-off coming and got trapped in the first one or two and hoped for a resumption of the bull market is now convinced it’s yet another buying opportunity. Then the selling stops for a day or two or three, and in this pocket of calm like the eye of a hurricane passing over, the bulls rush back in and drive prices up almost vertically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trapped bulls now have no impulse to get out and miss the continuation of the bull market and this massive rally only further reinforces the bulls’ bias towards the market. This is evidenced from the resurgence in bullish rhetoric and football spiking on the bears. Then a day or two later the selling inexplicably continues and the bulls get battered again. Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the bottom falls out and the market collapses and real fear, not the horse shit sentiment readings like the NAAIM and CNN Fear and Greed Index takes hold and nobody wants to touch risky assets. Then you may be closer to a bottom. We ain’t there yet. Not even close. There are just way too many permabulls convinced of their genius at this stage for me to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This market is very mixed despite all of the bullish rhetoric. Breadth has not returned and now money is extremely concentrated in a small basket of stocks which just happens to be what the S&amp;amp;P tracks and the S&amp;amp;P is what everyone follows so it has everyone masked from the extreme volatility happening beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, that’s a bit disingenuous. There’s been a lot of commentary noting that underlying volatility, but most view it as bullish rather than worrisome because they think that the selling in those high beta stocks has likely bottomed and now everything will resume the uptrend. If the megacaps give way the entire market is going to come down and in a terrifying way. I don’t think anyone is really considering the amount of risk present right now given how heavily concentrated the average person’s wealth is in a few extremely expensive risk assets. I think we need a reminder that as iron-clad as Apple and Microsoft seem to be, they are risky assets. And despite the consensus view that they are cheap, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not overcomplicate this. My read on the market hasn’t changed. The recent weakness is all about the Fed. The market weakened significantly after the November FOMC and has not recovered. It got even weaker after the December meeting where a doubling of the taper was announced with rate hikes coming as soon as March. Every other narrative is a sideshow and while it’s possible we can regain some upside in the interim, I expect selling to resume soon. The constant spikes in price are a necessary ingredient of any lasting sell off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every market cycle is different and in this cycle I truly believe you &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; a resilient market during the slide to keep people in. In a way, if the market just sold off 20% it would be too easy because it would make everyone bearish at once and nobody would get drawn back in during the drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems easy to say that every dip over the past few years was a great buying opportunity. But the reality is that in Febrary of 2018, a 10% slide was enough to terrify people out of stocks. In December of 2018 it took a 20% drop over a few months. There is no such reluctance to buy risk assets currently so we know it’s going to take more than what we’ve seen to this point. The idea that we have a bottom because of what’s happened to the ARKK stocks is laughable. Yes, there is real fear in everyone else. You escaped unscathed, sir. As I like to point out regularly, real fear is achieved when everyone is terrified, bulls and bears, and for completely legitimate reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question you should always ask yourself if you’re trying to call a market top is, what is going to make people shun risk assets enough to miss out on the next bull market? When trying to spot a bottom you have to look for a complete reluctance to trust stocks or risk assets of any kind. You yourself as the oh so wise bear should feel some palpable nervousness too. No, you aren’t immune or better than anyone else and you too will probably be afraid to buy when an actual bottom is in. Best to just accept that reality. Cash goes from being trash to being the most valuable asset.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">They are of a different character than typical bull market rallies and have these traits in common:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Narrative Shifts</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/16/sentiment-shifts.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Narrative Shifts" /><published>2021-12-16T09:35:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-16T09:35:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/12/16/sentiment-shifts</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/16/sentiment-shifts.html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most remarkable things I’ve witnessed in some time is the shift in narrative that has occurred over the past month, although I’m not sure why I should be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday at 2:00pm the hugely-anticipated FOMC decision was released, followed by a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to paint the full picture, let’s rewind to early November to the last FOMC meeting. At that meeting, the plan to begin tapering asset purchases was first announced. This was after growing pressure from economists and even increasingly market watchers who in the past had criticized any hawkish fed moves. The inflation numbers were too great and the idea of the fed continuing to pump billions of dollars a month into a red-hot economy was too much to ignore. The Fed up to that meeting had been as unambiguously doveish as any Fed in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to that announcement, small caps began to sell off and the VALUG officially hit a 4% week over week downtrend. Then on Thanksgiving night, news of the COVID Omicron variant hit and the market sold off hard. Even after it became apparent that the economy was not going to shut down again and that the Omnicron might actually be positive since it could be more transmissible but less deadly than the standard or Delta variants, the market continued down. This made it pretty apparent to me that the market weakness was mostly due to the November FOMC decision and the Omicron was just another weight added to the barbell for an already weak market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the days ahead of yesterday’s FOMC, reports began to circulate that the Fed might actually &lt;b&gt;double&lt;/b&gt; its tapering rate and start rate hikes sooner, possibly as early as March (just a few months ago it was debated whether they would raise them at all in 2022 but that even if they did it was almost certainly not going to happen before Fall). A double-whammy for stocks, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these rumors circulating of a more hawkish fed, selling indeed began to accelerate ahead of yesterday’s FOMC. But in the days leading up to the meeting, I began to read lots of commentary and opinions from clever market watchers who believed that with so much selling, the market had likely priced in any tapering and that the risk on decision day was actually to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday morning the market was pretty red and at 2:00pm Eastern when the minutes were released and the Fed did what the commentators had anticipated and formally announced a doubling of the rate of tapering and predicting three rate hikes the market initially began to sell off a bit and rates across the curve spiked higher. But the markets quickly reversed course and then stocks essentially went vertical into the close with the Nasdaq-100 staging a 500 point reversal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, it would seem to most that the permabulls have won another decisive battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… (there’s always a but)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across the following article written in March of 2000 in the early stages of the dot-com bust: &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/21/markets/markets_newyork/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wall St.: what rate hike?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the parallels between that article and the present environment interesting. Even though in March of 2000 the Fed was already in the midst of a tightening cycle and rates were much higher than they are now and that hike resulted in an inverted yield curve, I think the situations are similar in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Greenspan announced that hike, the market rallied over 2% on the back of that news and as demonstrated in that CNN article, the narrative shifted to paint the rate hike as a positive and explaining the initial market reaction due to the hike being “priced-in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That move higher also demonstrated the thrust of bear market rallies. You see, bear market rallies fool everyone, bulls and bears, and that’s because they create the reality (yes, the reality, not the illusion), that the bull market is back on. It has to. Contrary to popular belief, market participants aren’t stupid or irrational. They won’t simply buy into a resurrection of the bull market if it’s not convincing. Bears won’t abandon their bearish theses and cover shorts if the rallies don’t seem to be extraordinarily powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I’m not buying yesterday’s rally, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is simply no way the Fed doubling the pace of tapering and now planning three rate hikes in 2022, with the first coming as early as March is bullish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Markets that rally 2% in the midst of a downtrend near ATH’s are more likely in a bear market than not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To that point, we are still in a downtrend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There has been very little damage to sentiment still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What I find really interesting amidst this chaos though is how opinions change. Just a couple of months ago, even tapering was highly in question. Now with an accelerated taper and three hikes being announced, the market commentators are heralding this as bullish. It’s amazing what a combination of a bullish bias, long positions, and a couple hour’s worth of supportive price action can do to people’s sentiment. People are now totally convinced a hawkish fed is bullish and are calling for a Santa Claus rally into year end! I have to admit I never saw this coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect heavy selling to return soon, as early as today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One of the most remarkable things I’ve witnessed in some time is the shift in narrative that has occurred over the past month, although I’m not sure why I should be surprised.</summary></entry></feed>
